# Battleship
## Description
This repository hosts a JavaScript implementation of the classic game "Battleship." The game is built with Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. Players strategically guess the location of their opponent's ships on a grid. The application features classes for ships, gameboards, and players, including a basic AI for computer-controlled opponents.

## How to Use
Start a game and place your ships on the gameboard. On your turn, select a coordinate to attack on the enemy's board. The game tracks hits, misses, and sunk ships. Play alternates between you and the computer. The game ends when all of one player's ships are sunk.
